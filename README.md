In this repo it contains all problems which I have solved in project euler site. It is unpolished code and requires a lot of clean up! Hopefully I spend few days to clean this repo and make the code polished.
It's somewhere around 114 problems solved till now. This was done like back in August 2024 starting and since then have taken a break. I wish to join soon.

Pls forgive me for this horrible looking unorganized piece of crap.
